            This connection to hats goes beyond fashion; it's an expression of self-discovery and authenticity, suggesting that hats symbolize a deeper sense of identity, culture, and history. It conveys that genuine style isn't just about following trends, but rather about embracing something that resonates from within, driven by an intrinsic force that reflects one's true essence.

            In summary, "Beyond the Brim" is a personal zine that delves into the multifaceted significance of hats, particularly within African American culture, from historical roots to contemporary expressions. It celebrates the power of hats as symbols of identity and resistance, challenging stereotypes and norms while fostering a sense of community for Black, queer, and non-binary individuals. Through writing, photography, and design, the zine serves as a creative outlet and platform for storytelling, embracing authenticity and inspiring others to do the same.
